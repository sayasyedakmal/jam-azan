# jam-azan

This is web simulator for athan clock or jam azan or prayer clock.

Purpose of this project:
- To practice HTML and CSS
- This simulator won't have any working functionality just yet. It just for me to practice my HTML and CSS skills.
  Especially on CSS layout.
- Additional features will be added in different project/repo later.

My personal goal, or you might say the ultimate goal is to be a replacement for physical electronic athan clock.

By definition, an Athan clock, also known as a prayer time clock or Islamic prayer clock, 
is a device designed to help Muslims keep track of the five daily prayer times. 
The term "Athan" refers to the call to prayer (Adhan in Arabic) that is announced from the mosque's minaret to signal the upcoming prayer.

This simulator will have the following features (ticked means it is implemented):
- [ ] Show current date and time
- [ ] Show current day
- [ ] Show an Islamic Themed background
- [ ] Show all prayer time. (Subuh, Syuru', Zohor, Azar, Magrib, Isya')
